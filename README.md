`vioplot` `reshape2` `ggplot2` `patchwork` `quantreg` `hexbin` `GGally` `ggfortify` `kableExtra`, `htmltools` `rmarkdown` `bookdown` `xfun` `knitr` `rsvg` `remotes` `formatR` `here` `mosaic`

You can do this using the following code:

`install.packages(c('vioplot', 'reshape2', 'ggplot2', 'patchwork', 'quantreg', 'hexbin', 'GGally', 'ggfortify', 'kableExtra', 'htmltools', 'rmarkdown', 'bookdown', 'xfun', 'knitr', 'rsvg', 'remotes', 'formatR', 'here', 'mosaic'))`

You will also need to install the `icons` package from GitHub and also the download the fontawesome icons using:

`remotes::install_github("mitchelloharawild/icons")`

`icons::download_fontawesome(version = "dev")`

To render the book you can either hit the 'Build Book' button (in the build tab) in RStudio or run the following line of code in the console:

`rmarkdown::render_site(output_format = 'bookdown::gitbook', encoding = 'UTF-8')`

If you've just installed the bookdown package then you may need to restart RStudio for the 'Build' tab to appear.
