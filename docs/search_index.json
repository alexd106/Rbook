If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1: Here is a nice table!
